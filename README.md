# 📘 Life Expectancy Analysis Using Power BI

## 🌍 Project Title: **Life Expectancy Dashboard | Power BI Case Study**

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis, [visualization & dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/links/jdIalhdl7M?ctid=6c3a6b9e-a1bb-4e39-8899-b86d6898245e&pbi_source=linkShare) case study using **Power BI**, focused on the **Life Expectancy Dataset** sourced from **Kaggle**. The dataset contains crucial health and economic indicators for various countries across different years.

The goal of this analysis was to understand how factors like **mortality rates**, **infant deaths**, **alcohol consumption**, **GDP health expenditure**, **immunization coverage**, and **disease occurrence** impact the **average life expectancy** across countries.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean and transform raw datasets using Power Query Editor
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Build interactive multi-page dashboards
- Extract meaningful business and health insights
- Tell compelling data stories using visual elements

## 📁 Dataset Information

The dataset includes:
- **Life expectancy (in years)**
- **Adult Mortality** (probability of dying between age 15–60)
- **Infant Deaths** (per 1000 live births)
- **Alcohol consumption** (per capita, 15+ years old)
- **Health expenditure** (% of GDP)
- **Hepatitis B immunization** (% of 1-year-olds)
- **Measles cases**, **HIV/AIDS**, **Polio**, **Under-five deaths**, **BMI**, **Thinness indicators**, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool           | Purpose                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Power BI**   | Data cleaning, transformation & visualization |
| **Power Query**| Handling missing values, replacing nulls, formatting |
| **DAX**        | Creating KPIs and calculated fields       |
| **Custom Visuals** | Word Cloud, Donut Chart, Pie Chart     |

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performed in Power Query Editor:

- Replaced all **null** or **blank cells** with `0` to ensure smooth calculations.
- Reviewed each column for data types and inconsistencies.
- Applied necessary filters for accurate analysis and performance optimization.
- Ensured consistency across all numeric and categorical values.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview (Multiple Pages)

The report consists of **4 pages**, each focused on a different analytical aspect:

---

### 🔹 Page 1: Life Expectancy KPIs and Slicer View

- **Slicer** for year selection.
- **Word Cloud** to visualize countries by life expectancy.
- **Cards** for:
  - Max, Min, and Avg Life Expectancy
  - Max & Min BMI
  - Max & Min Thinness (1–19 years)
  - Total number of countries

---

### 🔹 Page 2: Mortality Insights

- **Stacked Column Chart**: Country vs Adult Mortality.
- **Column Chart**: Country vs Infant Deaths (segmented by Status: Developed/Developing).

---

### 🔹 Page 3: Immunization & Disease Matrix

- **Matrix Visual**: Displays data country-wise for:
  - Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio
  - Under-five deaths, Infant deaths
  - HIV/AIDS, Alcohol consumption

---

### 🔹 Page 4: GDP & Health Expenditure Visuals

- **Line & Stacked Column Chart**:
  - X-axis: Country
  - Line Y-axis: GDP
  - Column Legend: Status

- **Pie Charts**:
  - Total expenditure by Status
  - Percentage of GDP spent on healthcare

- **Donut Charts**:
  - Top 5 countries with the highest Under-Five Deaths
  - Top 5 countries with the highest Adult Mortality

---

## 📌 Key Insights Extracted

- Higher **healthcare expenditure** correlates with higher **life expectancy**.
- **Developing nations** face higher **adult and infant mortality rates**.
- Countries with better **immunization coverage** and **GDP** show significantly higher life expectancy.
- **Alcohol consumption** and **HIV/AIDS prevalence** impact life expectancy negatively in some regions.
